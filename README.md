# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

Part of my Coursera certification for IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, this analysis focuses on Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey:

- **Current Technology Usage**: Explores top 10 languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
- **Future Technology Trends**: Predicts desired languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks for the upcoming year.
- **Demographics**: Highlights gender distribution, country-wise respondent count, age demographics, and educational backgrounds.

This project offers insights into the current tech landscape, future trends, and the diverse demographics of the global developer community.

### IT Medical Records System assessment and results visualization (_August 2023_)   

As part of my role as a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, I spearheaded a program that involved assessing the documentation protocols within an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system. This assessment aimed to pinpoint the specific areas within the system where crucial information was being documented.

The assessment delved into understanding how information outlined in the protocols was captured across different sections of the EMR system. To visualize these findings comprehensively, I utilized a Sankey diagram, providing a clear depiction of the flow and allocation of documented information within the EMR system.

This project not only involved meticulous assessment but also the presentation of insights using visualization techniques, offering a holistic view of information capture and allocation within the EMR system.
