## Projects
## Health Monitoring Device Atlas (_Dec 2025_)   
Health Device Atlas is an interactive digital platform designed to map, classify, and visualize wearable and implantable health-monitoring technologies across the human body. The platform translates complex scientific evidence into an intuitive, 3D-based interface that allows users to explore health devices by body location, invasiveness level, physiological signals, and supporting research.

The platform focuses on non-invasive and minimally invasive monitoring technologies, such as smartwatches, smart rings, and biosensors, reflecting the growing shift toward continuous, user-acceptable, real-world health monitoring. Each device is presented with structured metadata, including the physiological parameters measured (e.g., heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature, sleep metrics), signal types, limitations, and links to peer-reviewed studies.
To enhance usability and standardization, devices are visually encoded by invasiveness level:
-	● Circle — Non-invasive (wearable)
-	■ Square — Minimally invasive
-	▲ Triangle — Invasive

## AI Tools Dashboard for Meta‑Analysis Evidence Synthesis (_Nov 2025_)   
An interactive dashboard built with HTML on Replit, visualizing how different AI tools are used across the stages of meta-analyses. Developed with the guidance of AI agents, the dashboard helps highlight usage trends, identify gaps, and generate actionable insights for researchers.

Project Details / Highlights:
-	Tech stack: HTML in Replit.
-	Data visualized: Frequency and distribution of AI tool usage across meta-analysis phases.
-	Purpose: Provide an evidence‑driven tool to explore where AI is most/least used in systematic reviews.
-	Process: Designed iteratively with AI agents for data structuring and user‑friendly charts.

## Geospatial Analysis of Job Listings: Visualizing Employment Hotspots Using Python and Folium (_Mar 2025_)   
In this analysis, I utilized Python, along with libraries such as pandas, folium, and matplotlib, to plot job listings across various locations on an interactive map. The dataset includes job positions, company details, and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). By grouping the job listings by location and highlighting the top 10 locations with the highest number of jobs in red, while the rest are marked in blue, the map provides a clear visual representation of the geographic distribution of employment opportunities. This visualization helps in identifying key employment hotspots across different regions.

## Power BI dashboard to visualize health audit data (_Feb 2024_)   
As part of my role at MTaPS, I worked on a program that involved creating visuals for audit data, which was presented as numerical percentages and included four relevant indicators. I developed a dashboard using Power BI, leveraging DAX code to create measures that effectively presented the data. This allowed for a clear and comprehensive visualization, facilitating better analysis and decision-making based on the audit results.

## Medical records information system assessment and results visualization (_August 2023_)   

As part of my role at MTaPS, I worked on a program that involved assessing the documentation of newly introduced practice protocols within an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system. This assessment aimed to pinpoint the specific areas within the system where crucial information was being documented.
The assessment delved into understanding how the information outlined in the protocols was captured across different sections of the EMR system. 

To visualize these findings comprehensively, I utilized a Sankey diagram, in Rstudio providing a clear depiction of the flow and allocation of documented information within the EMR system. This project not only involved meticulous assessment but also the presentation of insights using visualization techniques, offering a holistic view of information capture and allocation within the EMR system.

## Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis (_April 2023_)

Part of my Coursera certification for IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, this analysis focuses on Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey:

- **Current Technology Usage**: Explores top 10 languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
- **Future Technology Trends**: Predicts desired languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks for the upcoming year.
- **Demographics**: Highlights gender distribution, country-wise respondent count, age demographics, and educational backgrounds.

This project offers insights into the current tech landscape, future trends, and the diverse demographics of the global developer community.

## One million records data aggregation using SQL (_August 2022_)   
As part of my role at MTaPS, I conducted data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and analysis. This comprehensive process involved several steps: removing duplicate records, filtering data to prioritize relevant records for officials to respond effectively to serious adverse events, and translating labels for data aggregation.

The initial dataset comprised 712,324 records within the surveillance system. This dataset underwent two phases of meticulous cleaning. Initially, duplicate records were identified and removed, resulting in a refined total of 489,461 records. The data cleaning and aggregation processes were executed using Microsoft Data Management in SQL. Subsequently, the tables were extracted and processed in Excel for further analysis.

## Excel interactive report (_July 2021_)   
Within the HSD project, I developed an Excel dashboard. This dashboard generates reports and graphs that dynamically update as new data is entered or deleted. The dashboard provided information on the primary CS audit report that could be compiled into a printable report and presented through charts. The report encompassed detailed insights and analysis.

## Meta-analysis on the association between breast cancer and reproductive factors (_Jan 2019_)   

I conducted a meta-analysis based on a systematic review aiming to assess the correlation between breast cancer risk and various reproductive factors such as parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding. Utilizing RevMan 5.0 software, I created Forest and funnel plots to visually represent the outcomes of this review.

Moreover, in addition to employing RevMan, I utilized RStudio 1.1.456 to identify potential outliers and influential studies within the data. This involved analyzing externally studentized residuals, Cook’s distances, and other case deletion diagnostics derived from linear regression analyses. These measures were instrumental in assessing the robustness and impact of individual studies on the overall findings.
