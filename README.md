# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis (_April 2023_)

Part of my Coursera certification for IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, this analysis focuses on Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey:

- **Current Technology Usage**: Explores top 10 languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
- **Future Technology Trends**: Predicts desired languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks for the upcoming year.
- **Demographics**: Highlights gender distribution, country-wise respondent count, age demographics, and educational backgrounds.

This project offers insights into the current tech landscape, future trends, and the diverse demographics of the global developer community.

# One million records data aggregation using SQL (_August 2022_)   
As part of my role at MTaPS, I conducted data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and analysis. This comprehensive process involved several steps: removing duplicate records, filtering data to prioritize relevant records for officials to respond effectively to serious adverse events, and translating labels for data aggregation.

The initial dataset comprised 712,324 records within the surveillance system. This dataset underwent two phases of meticulous cleaning. Initially, duplicate records were identified and removed, resulting in a refined total of 489,461 records. The data cleaning and aggregation processes were executed using Microsoft Data Management in SQL. Subsequently, the tables were extracted and processed in Excel for further analysis.

# IT Medical Records System assessment and results visualization (_August 2023_)   

As part of my role as a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, I worked on a program that involved assessing the documentation of newly introduced practice protocols within an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system. This assessment aimed to pinpoint the specific areas within the system where crucial information was being documented.
The assessment delved into understanding how the information outlined in the protocols was captured across different sections of the EMR system. To visualize these findings comprehensively, I utilized a Sankey diagram, in Rstudio providing a clear depiction of the flow and allocation of documented information within the EMR system. This project not only involved meticulous assessment but also the presentation of insights using visualization techniques, offering a holistic view of information capture and allocation within the EMR system.

### Meta-analysis (_forst plots_) on the association between breast cancer and reproductive factors (_Jan 2019_)   

I conducted a meta-analysis based on a systematic review aiming to assess the correlation between breast cancer risk and various reproductive factors such as parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding. Utilizing RevMan 5.0 software, I created Forest and funnel plots to visually represent the outcomes of this review.

Moreover, in addition to employing RevMan, I utilized RStudio 1.1.456 to identify potential outliers and influential studies within the data. This involved analyzing externally studentized residuals, Cookâ€™s distances, and other case deletion diagnostics derived from linear regression analyses. These measures were instrumental in assessing the robustness and impact of individual studies on the overall findings.

### Excel dashboard (_July 2021_)   
Within the HSD project, I developed an Excel dashboard. This dashboard generates reports and graphs that dynamically update as new data is entered or deleted. The dashboard provided information on the primary CS audit report that could be compiled into a printable report and presented through charts. The report encompassed detailed insights and analysis.
