# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

Part of my Coursera certification for IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, this analysis focuses on Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey:

- **Current Technology Usage**: Explores top 10 languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
- **Future Technology Trends**: Predicts desired languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks for the upcoming year.
- **Demographics**: Highlights gender distribution, country-wise respondent count, age demographics, and educational backgrounds.

This project offers insights into the current tech landscape, future trends, and the diverse demographics of the global developer community.
